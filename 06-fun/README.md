06 - Fun!
=========
Two Demos that illustrate some more complex examples of WebGL.

6-1 - Boid Flocking AI
----------------------
Simple flocking algorithm based on [this algorithm](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/).  Uses some bin optimizations to try to save some computation, but didn't get quite enough time to fully optimize it.

6-2 - Simple Model Loader
-------------------------
Demonstrates .css animated menus interacting with the WebGL context in addition to loading basic model formats, the same model format of the included enterprise.  Uses the `CameraController` to rotate the model, +/- to zoom in and out.  Two buttons enable/disable lighting and draw in wireframe/non-wireframe mode.  Simply drag and drop a model into the canvas to load it in.  Also demonstrates stretching a canvas across the whole screen and responding to window resizing events.
