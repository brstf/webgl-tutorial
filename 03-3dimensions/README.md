Simple WebGL Model Viewer
=========================

A WebGL powered model viewer, simply drag and drop a model to view.  Click on the option buttons to change rendering options.  Currently it is possible to switch between solid rendering and wireframe mode, and toggle lighting on and off.

Currently only supports a very basic '.data' format where data is specified as v0, v1, v2, v0, v3, v4, v5, v3, etc.
